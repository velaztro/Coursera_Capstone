This means the demand for Airbnb accomodation is only going to grow further and more people would want to be in the game. \n- How should a new business person decide where to open a Airbnb?\n- What factors should he look at before investing?\n- Which neighborhood venues affect a user's rating for *location* of an Airbnb?\n\nAt the same time, it is difficult for a travellers, especially first-timers, to select an Airbnb from among many options. Airbnb reviews are subjective and differ from person-to-person and one cannot solely depend on them to make a decision. It is especially important to consider other aspects like price and neighborhood, which can greatly influence one's experience of the city/country.\nI will try to answer the following questions \n- How does price vary with location?\n- How does proximity to transportation affect hostel rating?\n- Suggest similar hostel but which cheaper price\n\nFor this project, we will be looking at Airbnbs in Mexico, in particular, Mexico City."
